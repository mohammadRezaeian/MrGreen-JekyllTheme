<h1><b>Hi
I writing this document because I think some times we need use maximum frequency CPU or GPU alternative let's set it ourselves instead of leaving it to the kernel </b> </h1>

<b>After that what's happen ?</b> <br>
be carefully this work causes the power will increase and its temperature will also increase

<h3>ok now let's go </h3>

wee need install this package:

<b>in fedora</b>
<br>
`sudo dnf install cpufrequtils -y`
<br>
in debian:
<br>
`sudo apt install cpufrequtils -y`
<h4> Now we wan't increase frequency cpu

it's very easy reallyðŸ˜ƒ you just need  use this command:
<br>
`sudo cpufreq-set -g  performance`
<br>
<h3> Now maybe asking how to make sure that it has increased</h3>
it's very easy just write this command:
<br>
`cpufreq-info`
<br>
if your output line <b>current policy: the governor  was "performance" it's increased</b>.

<i>thank you for reading this post
I wish you to have a nice day
have a great time.</i>
