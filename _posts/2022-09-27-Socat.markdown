<h1><b>Hi
I writing this document because I think this time all Iranians need help for Limitations of internet. </b> </h1>

<b>maybe you ask why?</b> <br>
because now many times internet changes to Intranet   and it's just Intranet 
maybe you ask what's the meaning of intranet
It's better to say that national network is using rather than Intranet.
I think now you understand what's the meaning of intranet yeah it's true 
it's a house without any Connections  to out 


<h3>ok now let's go </h3>

how Port Forward Received to another destination  use <b>socat</b> for <b>UDP Protocol</b>:

it's very easy reallyðŸ˜ƒ you just need 

<b>use this command:</b>
<br>

`sudo socat -ddd UDP4-RECVFROM:writePortRecivedData,fork UDP4-SENDTO:DestinationIP:Port`

<h5>yeah it's very easy and now description :</h5>

you just need to <b>replace writePortRecivedData</b>  with  <b>port</b>  that you want to accept data from it
and just <b>replace DestinationIP </b> with address that you need to <b>forward data to the port</b> that is your <b>destination port</b>

<h4>like this:</h4>

`sudo socat -ddd UDP4-RECVFROM:878,fork UDP4-SENDTO:127.0.0.1:404`


<h3>and for TCP Protocol:</h3>

`sudo socat -ddd tcp-listen:writePortRecivedData,reuseaddr,fork tcp:DestinationIP:Port`

<h5>yeah it's very easy and now description :</h5>


you just need to <b>replace writePortRecivedData</b>  with  <b>port</b>  that you want to accept data from it
and just <b>replace DestinationIP </b> with address that you need to <b>forward data to the port</b> that is your <b>destination port</b>
