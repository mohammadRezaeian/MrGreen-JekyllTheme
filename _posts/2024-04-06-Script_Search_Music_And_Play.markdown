<h1><b>Introduction to Script_Find_Music_And_Play:</b></h1>

<b>Maybe you ask why I wrote this?</b> <br>

Back when I was 21 years old, I found myself drowning in a sea of music files on my computer,resembling a chaotic data center. 
Searching for a specific song often felt like navigating through a maze of subdirectories.

To alleviate this frustration, I took matters into my own hands and crafted a solution: **<a href="https://github.com/mohammadRezaeian/Search_Music_and_Playe">Script_Find_Music_And_Play</a>**.

This script leverages the power of MPlayer for playback and utilizes the 'find' command to swiftly locate your music files on your computer. Say goodbye to endless searches and hello to seamless music enjoyment.

<i>Thank you for reading this post. I wish you to have a nice day and a great time.</i>
