<h1><b>Hi
I just write this because of I think I just must write </b> </h1>

<b>Maybe ask me for what?</b> <br>
Nothing 
yeah really nothing 


<h3>ok now let's go </h3>

<b>First of I Must tell you in the past for humans important thought was love</b><br>
hmmm maybe you now tell what do you mean<br>
wait I tell you<br>

love is not a love between two people<br>
yeah trust me<br>
it's possible happen between a human and an animal like horses and a human or<br>
I don't know an inanimate like<br>
love between a human and a laptop or a pc yeah believe me it's possible<br>
maybe you ask me how is it possible?<br>
I tell you wait<br>

imagine you are a last of human in the ground you don't have anything and you just have a pc or laptop<br>
and you are a developer <br>
for better life what do you doing<br>
maybe you tell me<br>
trying to create a garden for farming or I don't know finding a cow for milk or other works<br>
but when you need to rest what do you do?<br>
think you are alone and you are the last of human in the ground<br>
I am telling you if I was, I just sating in chair and work with pc or laptop and just trying to create a friend<br>
<b>maybe now telling me for what?</b><br>
wait!! I tell you<br>
for just a talk together<br>
ok now imagine you create a friend  and it's talking to you every time<br>
<b>and now</b>
first of you thinking such wow<br>
I did it and it's alive and it's can talk<br>
and can help me into everything after a during time you think you can't live without it<br>
but in the one night It will be ruined.  and now no one to talk with you <br>
now what are you doing?<br>
you are trying to repair it but you can't<br>

now  Get out of the dream <br>
you live in the ground and many humans are around you but you can't talk with anyone <br>
and you just talk with your system<br>
and maybe you are an engineer or a hacker and<br>
you are talking to your codes.<br>
after many months you created a big program<br>
and you are loving it, maybe ask me why<br>
because you create it and<br>
You will grow it.<br>
now it's like your baby<br>

now you can see love can happen between a human and an inanimate.<br>

<b>these are just was a secretions of a tired mind</b>
