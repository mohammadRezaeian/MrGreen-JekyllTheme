<h1><b>Hi
I writing this document because I think OpenWRT is the best Alternative for firmware Close Source in Modems </b> </h1>

<b>maybe you ask why?</b> <br>
because now many devices can't update or company you bought the modem from it doesn't has support for updating 
or others reasons 
or think this reason is  very important for me : <b>we want better security and config firewall</b>
or you wan't run many services for manage your network home like: run a nextcloud for acess out local network, run AdgaurdHome for manage dns resolved,
configuration firewall for set acess clients or connect out Local Network to Local Network
or open port or forward port to specifice client
and many others services or works.
trust me it's amazing 

<h3>ok now let's go </h3>

first of we must check it's has support from we device or not
for check it we must check this address:

https://openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_available_16128

ok 
<h3>Maybe now you confused for select a device because There are too many of them </h3>

ok i helping you for find a device

first of we must let's pay attention it's support <b>final version OpenWRT or not</b><br>
second we must to know it's has <b>Support all technology  we need</b>
like: how many support <b>Connection ethernet</b><br>
and it's has support <b>SimCard</b> if it yes which porotocls it's has support like: 5G, 4G, 3G <br>
which <b>porotocol</b> it's has support for <b>Bandwith</b> like:  6GH A(wifi), 6GH(Wifi), 5GH(Wifi), 2.5GH <br>
which <b>Security</b>  it's has support: AES256, BlueFish or Others<br>
chipset wifi it's has support <b>DualBand</b> or not: like connect to wifi or hotspot <br>

i thinking thoses are very important And I will try to add more in the future
<br>
