<h1><b>Hi
I writing this document because  in the past i wanted to create many components without use C++, And setting up version for up them  </b> </h1>


<b>maybe you ask why?</b> <br>
Just see your projects <br>
You trying create many custom components for your projects first of everything it's fine because they are not very much<br>
Nut after months or week you seeing oh they are very much and It's very confused, <br>

Until this everything  it's ok <br>
you again try for continue but again you trying create new components with many new feature<br>
Maybe you saying it's ok <br>
Maybe you saying it's ok i must just create new directory <br>
Or i must just use  git <br>
But they aren't best way  you need  create version for access  them. <br>

<h3>ok now let's go </h3>

<b>How to create QMLDir file</b>

1. create a directory for your components (it's not matter you use Qt creator or terminal linux or....) after that going into directory:
  * `create file qmldir (example i use terminal in Gnu\Linux)`
  * `touch qmldir`

2. open it and
   * `example i use directory with name DesingControls`
   * `module DesingControls (name attention you must Observe the big or small letters )`

3. open now open .pro file (because i use qmake alternative cmake)
   * `QML_IMPORT_PATH += $$PWD/src/Ui (example i create a directory src  and into i create directory Ui  for qml files)`
  
4. adding path components directory into main.cpp
   * `engine.addImportPath("qrc:/src/Ui"); (engin is a object of QQmlApplicationEngine)`

5. now thinking you must add version for specific custom components 
   * `CustomButton  1.0     CustomButton.qml`

<br>
and now oh how can must use it<br>
imaging it's so hard ðŸ˜‚

let's go to file qml and just add this <br>

example:
* `import DesingControls 1.0 `

<i>in feature i trying write a example project for it </i><br>

<i>thank you for reading this post<br>
I wish you have great time </i>
